The Fix Facebook Like plugin fixes problems like wrong thumbnail, title, description, URL, and gives few more options for your WordPress.

== Description ==

Facebook Like many times gives problems like wrong thumbnail (og:image), wrong title (og:site_name), wrong description (og:description), etc. This plugin fixes them, as it enforces WordPress post thumbnail for image if a post is liked, or your website's logo if home page is liked, post title if post is liked or blog title if home page is liked, it also uses excerpts for description(optional) or blog tagline if home page is liked.
In addition to these, it also gives the option to add your website type and admins of your website.
